    As a Sophomore at FTU, specializing in International Business Management, I am passionate about being the bridge between high-level global strategy and executable code. My core focus is Data Analysis—transforming raw market data into clear, actionable insights that drive competitive advantage in international commerce. I don't just solve business problems; I architect digital solutions for them. I am seeking opportunities to leverage my analytical skills and programming foundation to build scalable tools for the global market.
